						<li><b>WHAT IS AN “RG”?</b><br>
							<p>
								‘RG’ is an abbreviation for a Response Group. It is a group of people from
								but not limited to the police, first-response teams, local leaders
								community policing teams and residents who come together to identify, share
								and solve public safety issues in their locality. RGs can be formed at
								homes, workplaces, residential areas &amp; estates, business
								entities…virtually everywhere for easy sharing of public safety
								intelligence and incidences as they happen as well as prompting quick
								response and other complimentary support
							</p>
						</li>

						<li><b>Is there a limit on the number of RGs I can create?</b><br>
							<p>
								No. Alatpres allows users to create as many RGs as they can. However, you
								must upgrade to the PRO plan to create RGs depending on one’s safety needs.
								You can for-instance have a family RG, workplace RG, your business RG…

								groups upon request while approval to join is required for closed groups

						<li><b>What is Global RG?</b><br>
							<p>
								This is a dedicated channel that allows registered response
								authorities/teams to share real-time safety and incident information to the
								public. All users are automatically added to this group. Only enterprise
								accounts registered as first-responders can share Alats to the group.

								Alatpres allows users to add members and integrate response service
								providers into their groups to allow quick sharing of Alats to multiple
								response providers by a single click. Level configurations simply mean

								three levels of group configuration.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Level 1:</em>
								This configured automatically and includes only the members of the group.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Level2</em>
								: Here it is recommended you integrate response providers that will receive
								and action the group’s <strong>medium </strong>rated Alats. This can
								instance be your area community leader etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Level 3</em>
								: It is recommended adding response providers that will receive and action
								to the group’s <strong>high</strong> rated Alats. This can be for instance
								your local police station, county fire brigade etc.
							</p>

						</li>

						<li><b>Can I change my group configuration later?</b><br>
							<p>

						<li><b>I don’t have bundles, can I receive Alats?</b><br>
							<p>
								Yes. All Alats are delivered both to the user’s online dashboard as well
								offline via SMS. This ensures you don’t miss out on any critical
								life-saving information.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li><b>Why do I have to choose nature of Alat when creating an Alat?</b><br>
							<p>
								This allows an Alat to be shared to relevant pre-configured response teams
								for an appropriate response.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li><b>How do I determine an Alat is high, medium or low rated?</b><br>
							<p>
								<em>High risk Alat</em>
								<strong>: </strong>
								This can also be referred to a ‘critical Alat”. This is an incident alert
								for a life-threatening situation and massive property damage &amp; adverse
								public safety consequence is imminent. Prompt and useful response is
								required. Armed robbery, flooding, disease-outbreak, fire etc. are good
								examples of such Alat.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Medium risk Alat:</em>
								This can be an incident alert for a situation that has potential to cause
								human-harm, property damage or pose a public safety risk if left
								un-addressed. Level2 configured response teams will receive these nature of
								Alat.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Low risk Alat:</em>
								This is can be an incident alert that requires minimal to no response from
								the RG members and no one is at immediate risk of any sort of harm. E.g. a
								mere suspicion incident Alat
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Disclaimer:</em>
								Alatpres does not prescribe any criteria of rating Alats and the judgement
								is left upon the user to determine in consideration of other unique
								factors.
							</p>

						</li>

						<li><b>What happens if I submit an Alat by mistake?</b><br>
							<p>
								<em>
									If this happens, go to manage Alats&gt;&gt; active Alats&gt;&gt;click
									on the Alat&gt;&gt;withdraw the Alat
								</em>
